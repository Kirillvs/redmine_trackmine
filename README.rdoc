= Redmine Trackmine Plugin

The plugin integrates particular Redmine projects (or subprojects)
with Pivotal Tracker projects (or labels).

== Features

* Starting a story in a Pivotal Tracker automatically creates a Redmine issue.  
* Updating a story in a Pivotal Tracker updates the Redmine issue attributes (subject, description, status).  
* Closing a Redmine issue finishes the Pivotal Tracker story.
* Mapping between Pivotal Tracker and Redmine attributes can be configured
